# Mini-Cpp-Projects

This project is based off of self-learning. I learnt the basics of OpenCV library that include processing images, videos, webcam feed and finding shapes, colors, faces, and vehicle number plates. I also created 4 mini projects to implement the skills I learnt. C++ is an excellent language for implementation and creating real-world products/projects, so I chose this language to showcase my skills.

## Link to 4 mini projects made with C++ and OpenCV library.
